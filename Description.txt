Objective: 
Can you differentiate a weed from a crop seedling? Given an image differentiate between different plant types.

Context: The ability to do so effectively can mean better crop yields and better stewardship of the environment. The Aarhus University Signal Processing group, in collaboration with University of Southern Denmark, has recently released a dataset containing images of approximately 960 unique plants belonging to 12 species at several growth stages.

Data Description: You are provided with a training set and a test set of images of plant seedlings at various stages of grown. Each image has a filename that is its unique id. The dataset comprises 12 plant species. The goal of the competition is to create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a photo. The list of species is as follows: 
1.  Black-grass 
2.  Charlock 
3.  Cleavers 
4.  Common Chickweed 
5.  Common wheat 
6.  Fat Hen 
7.  Loose Silky-bent
8.  Maize 
9.  Scentless Mayweed 
10. Shepherds Purse 
11. Small-flowered Cranesbill 
12. Sugar beet
